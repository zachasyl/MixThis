\cf0 Pictures of the application are located in the MixThis/pictures folder

MixThis is a simple app that utilizes a search api form www.thecocktaildb.com; it was built while I learned to use public API on Android applications.\
\
Once the user enters input, the name of a drink, the application will parse through the returned JSON of matches; it will only look at the first returned drink and determine if that drink is an exact match. It will then parse through and GET all the ingredients as well as an image of the cocktail. The separate thread these processes are ran on will also dis play a circular progress bar until the thread\'92s tasks are complete.\
